# Release v2.6.15

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Fixed Issue #5 - Tilt Cover Slat Dimension Units Mismatch**

Resolved a critical 100x scaling error in tilt cover calculations caused by conflicting units in the configuration UI:

- **Problem:** The UI displayed "cm" with validation range 0.1-15, but help text instructed users to "Enter in METERS not centimeters", causing confusion and incorrect calculations
- **Impact:** Users entering values in centimeters (following the UI label) had their values treated as meters in calculations, resulting in slat angles being off by a factor of 100
- **Solution:** The integration now correctly converts centimeter values from the UI to meters internally before passing to calculation formulas

### Changes

- Added automatic cm-to-meter conversion in the coordinator's `tilt_data()` method
- Updated English translation help text to use centimeters consistently (removed "METERS" references)
- Updated examples in help text: 0.025m → 2.5cm, 0.05m → 5cm, etc.
- Updated README.md tilt variables table to clarify units are in centimeters
- Added warning log for suspiciously small values (<0.1 cm) that may indicate users followed old instructions

### Migration Note

If you previously entered slat dimensions in **meters** (following the old help text), you will see a warning in your logs. Please reconfigure your tilt cover and enter values in **centimeters**:
- If your slats are 2.5cm wide, enter `2.5` (not `0.025`)
- If your slats are 5cm wide, enter `5` (not `0.05`)

Most users who followed the UI label won't need to change anything - your blinds will now work correctly!

## 🧪 Testing

- Added 2 new unit tests for cm-to-meter conversion
- All 191 tests passing
- Calculation module coverage: 91%
- Fixed linting issues in test files
