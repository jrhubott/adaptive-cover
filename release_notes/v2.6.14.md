## 🎯 Bug Fix Release: Climate Mode & Sensor Reliability

This release fixes critical bugs in climate mode winter operation and improves sensor reliability during startup.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Winter Mode Priority (Issue #4)**
- Fixed winter mode not activating on sunny days without lux/irradiance sensors
- Winter mode now correctly prioritizes temperature-based decisions over light conditions
- Ensures blinds open to 100% for solar heating when indoor temp is below comfort threshold
- Restructured `normal_with_presence()` and `tilt_with_presence()` logic with clear priority order:
  1. Winter mode (temp-based) → 100% for solar heating
  2. Low light conditions → default position
  3. Summer mode → 0% or calculated
  4. Normal glare calculation → sun tracking

**Sensor Startup Reliability (Issue #3)**
- Fixed TypeError crashes when temperature, lux, or irradiance sensors are unavailable at startup
- Common with Zigbee2MQTT and Z-Wave devices that take 20-60 seconds to initialize
- Integration now uses safe defaults and automatically recovers when sensors become available
- Added graceful None value handling for all climate sensor properties

**Translation Variable (Issue #2)**
- Fixed translation error in config flow when displaying form without legacy entries
- Added missing `legacy_count` placeholder variable

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated README with priority-based climate decision system explanation
- Added "Sensor Startup Reliability" section documenting automatic recovery behavior
- Clarified winter mode behavior and priority over weather/light conditions

### 🧪 Testing

- Added 5 comprehensive unit tests for winter mode scenarios
- Added 4 unit tests for sensor None value handling
- All 189 tests passing
- Maintained 91% coverage for calculation.py

### 📦 Installation

**HACS:**
1. Go to HACS → Integrations
2. Find "Adaptive Cover Pro"
3. Click "Update" to install v2.6.14

**Manual:**
1. Download `adaptive_cover_pro.zip` from this release
2. Extract to `config/custom_components/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

### ⬆️ Upgrading from v2.6.13

No configuration changes required. The update includes:
- Improved winter mode reliability (especially on sunny days)
- Better handling of sensor unavailability during startup
- No breaking changes to existing configurations

After upgrading, if you use climate mode with winter strategy, you should see improved behavior on cold sunny mornings where blinds correctly open to 100% for solar heating.
