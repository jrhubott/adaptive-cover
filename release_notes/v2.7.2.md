# v2.7.2 - Bug Fix Release

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed startup crash**: Resolved `NameError: name 'callback' is not defined` in entity_base.py
  - The `callback` decorator was incorrectly placed in the `TYPE_CHECKING` block, making it unavailable at runtime
  - Moved import to runtime imports to fix startup failure affecting all platforms (sensor, switch, binary_sensor, button)

## 🧪 Testing

- Tested with Home Assistant 2025.11.0+
- Verified startup completes without errors
- All entities load correctly
