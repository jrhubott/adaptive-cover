## 🐛 Bug Fix: Custom Position Interpolation

Fixes critical bug in position interpolation (range adjustment) feature.

### What Was Fixed

- Removed buggy boundary normalization that forced 0% and 100% back to original values
- Fixed falsy value check preventing `end_value=0` from working
- Boundary values now correctly map through interpolation

### Now Works Correctly

- ✅ Limited range covers: `[0,100] → [10,90]`
- ✅ Inverted operation: `[0,100] → [100,0]`
- ✅ Non-linear mappings with custom point lists

### Testing

- Added 8 new interpolation tests
- All 233 tests pass
- No regressions

### Documentation

- Added Position Interpolation section to README.md with examples

**⚠️ Beta Release - Please Test:**
This is a beta release for testing. If you use the position interpolation feature, please test and report any issues.

Fixes #8
