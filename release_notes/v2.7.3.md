## 🐛 Critical Startup Fix

### Bug Fixes

**Fixed startup crash affecting multiple entities**
- Resolved `ValueError` crash in Last Cover Action sensor that prevented integration from loading
- Fixed cascading failures preventing switch entities from completing setup
- Removed incorrect empty unit attribute from text sensor that caused Home Assistant to interpret it as numeric

### Technical Details

**Root Cause:**
The Last Cover Action diagnostic sensor was configured with an empty unit of measurement (`""`), which Home Assistant's sensor platform interpreted as indicating a numeric sensor. When the sensor returned text values like "No action recorded", HA attempted to convert the text to a float, causing a `ValueError`.

**Impact:**
This crash occurred during coordinator refresh, which is triggered when switch entities complete their setup. The failure prevented:
- Last Cover Action sensor from loading
- All switch entities (automatic control, manual override, return to default, climate mode) from completing setup

**Solution:**
Text sensors without a device_class or state_class should not set a unit of measurement. The fix removes the empty unit attribute, allowing Home Assistant to correctly handle the text values.

### 🧪 Testing

- Tested on Home Assistant 2024.5.0+
- All entities now load successfully on startup
- Sensor correctly displays text values
- Switch entities complete setup without errors

### 📦 Installation

Update through HACS or manually replace the `custom_components/adaptive_cover_pro` directory with the new version. Restart Home Assistant to apply the fix.

**Note:** This is a critical fix for users experiencing startup errors with v2.7.0-v2.7.2. If your integration is loading successfully, you can update at your convenience.
