# v2.7.5-beta.3 - Force Override Sensors (Beta)

## 🎯 Weather Safety Protection

This beta release introduces force override sensors - a powerful safety feature that allows binary sensors to globally override automatic cover control.

## ✨ New Features

### Force Override Sensors
- **Weather Safety Protection**: Configure binary sensors (rain, wind, etc.) that override automatic control when active
- **Global Control**: When ANY configured sensor is active ("on"), ALL covers move to a configured safe position
- **Customizable Safe Position**:
  - Default: 0% (fully retracted/closed) - ideal for rain/wind protection
  - Configurable: Set to 100% for security sensors requiring emergency access
- **Manual Override Preserved**: Manual control still works during force override
- **Configuration Variables**:
  - `force_override_sensors`: List of binary sensor entity IDs to monitor
  - `force_override_position`: Target position (0-100%) when override is active

### Use Cases
- **Rain Protection**: Link to rain sensor → automatically retract awnings
- **Wind Protection**: Link to wind sensor → close blinds during high winds
- **Security**: Link to alarm sensor → open all covers for emergency access
- **Multiple Conditions**: Monitor multiple sensors simultaneously (ANY active triggers override)

## 🧪 Testing

This is a **beta release** for testing purposes. Please test thoroughly before using in production:

### Testing Checklist
- ✅ Configure force override sensors in integration options
- ✅ Test with binary sensor turning on/off
- ✅ Verify all covers move to configured position when sensor activates
- ✅ Verify automatic control resumes when sensor deactivates
- ✅ Test manual control works during force override
- ✅ Test with multiple sensors (any active should trigger override)

### Known Limitations
- Force override applies to ALL covers in the integration instance
- No per-cover override configuration (global only)

## 📦 Installation

**Beta Testing via HACS:**
1. Ensure you have HACS installed
2. Add custom repository: `https://github.com/jrhubott/adaptive-cover`
3. Install version `v2.7.5-beta.3`
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Update integration options to configure force override sensors

**Manual Installation:**
1. Download `adaptive_cover_pro.zip` from this release
2. Extract to `custom_components/adaptive_cover_pro/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Added `force_override_sensors` configuration option (list of entity IDs)
- Added `force_override_position` configuration option (default: 0%)
- Coordinator monitors all configured sensors for state changes
- Force override takes precedence over all other control logic
- New test coverage: 258 tests added for force override behavior
